1.top 3 products preferred by customers in clique bait store is, 
  
  Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens	        
  Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens	      
  Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens	     
  
2.Segment wise purchase analysis
Quantity wise - highest sold segment is Jacket
Highest revenue earned before and after discount is shirt
Highest discount is alloted to Shirt segment 
  
3.Category wise sales analysis
Men's category is earning us more revenue than the women's category, though the quantity wise highest sold is women clothing. Men clothing seem to be costly and still people preferred it because of high discounts given to it. 

From the segment and category analysis I find that, given the highest discounts people are preferring the product which in turn gives us more revenue.
